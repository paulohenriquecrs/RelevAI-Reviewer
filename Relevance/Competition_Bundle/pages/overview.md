**Introduction**


The RelevAI project, which is in the field of Information Retrieval (IR), focuses on academic literature. It is driven by the need to classify the relevance of papers in the scientific literature, a task that grows harder with large text volumes and diverse topics. The project aims to automate the process of assessing document relevance to specific prompts or queries, which has the potential to save users valuable time and effort. 

Traditional methods like text matching and keyword search often miss contextual meaning and word relationships, resulting in inaccurate relevance assessments. Therefore, this challenge proposes users to come up with Artificial Intelligence techniques to improve this task, capturing semantic and contextual aspects of the text to better predict its relevance. The successful development of an effective relevance ranking algorithm can have a significant impact on society. It can enhance literature reviews, accelerate scientific research, expedite breakthroughs in diverse fields, facilitate efficient literature searches, simplify information access, and enhance learning and decision-making processes.

**Task description**

This challenge aims to categorize candidate papers based on their alignment with a given prompt. It is formulated as a supervised learning problem, where the input consists of a prompt along with 4 candidate survey papers, and the desired output are the relevance classes to be assigned to each of these papers. Specifically, label 3 denotes the most relevance, 2 for the second most relevance, 1 for the second least relevance, and 0 for the least relevance.

You may find more details about the dataset configuration in the Data page.

In the Starting Kit page, we provide a notebook that displays some basic statistics and visual analysis of small sample of the dataset and tries some simple baselines as approaches to solve the challenge. You can use thoses baselines as inspiration to come up with new and better ideas for different approaches, using your creativity and imagination. The Starting Kit also contains all the programs and toolkits to generate a score report and a file to be submitted on the website page.
